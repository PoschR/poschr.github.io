Lately I am watching more and more whodunits. Mainly to get inspired for various
Pen and Paper campaigns I am running. It is fun.

{:.anim_p}
But often I feel cheated. Sometimes a major clue is only revealed once the protagonist
begins with the explanation. Sometimes even the solution hinges on the suspect
revealing it.

{:.anim_p}
It often feels like guess work on the protagonist's part. A myriad of circumstances however
could prove the protagonist's hypothesis wrong. And when that thought arises, I feel betrayed.

{:.anim_p}
You know, I get it. As a writer you want tension. As a writer you want the mystery to be a
mystery as long as possible. But usually the plot is paced so fast that withholding clues
is not necessary.

{:.anim_p}
Let me figure it out. Solving the mystery can be its own satisfaction. If you design
the mystery well enough, I will be entertained either way.

{:.anim_p}
Often I pause before the revelation and note all the clues down and try to figure it out
myself. Usually I get a good rough picture of what happened. Sometimes I figure it out. But
sometimes I would just miss an essential detail. A detail that was definitely present.

{:.anim_p}
And once our hero detective shows it in their exposure, I go like: Oooooh, that's what I have missed.
Everything was there, no clue was introduced once the explanation already begins. And I gain a respect 
without feeling cheated.
